Getting Started
===============
Firstly, you want to get c9v3, and get that running locally. Please follow the docs there.

The clone moz.aisle into the plugins directory, and create symlinks for the settings and configs files.

To start c9 as Aisle, pass in both config and settings:
    ~/.c9/node/bin/node server.js aisle -s aisle
Use `-p` for the port, and `-w` for the source directory of the localization files you edit.
